  <h2>Project Overview :</h2>
  <p>I designed this website almost 9 months ago when I started learning frontend development. The design isn't perfect since it's one of my very first projects. I created it using Figma. Although I had never used Figma before, I had experience with Photoshop and similar software, so I wasn't completely unfamiliar with the tools. Despite the differences, I managed to put this design together. You can check out the design on my Behance profile <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/184998863/Hosting-Website-UIUX-Design">[here]</a>. While developing the website, I made some changes, maintaining the overall design style but making a few adjustments here and there.</p>
